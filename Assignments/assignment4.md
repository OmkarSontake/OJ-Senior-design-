# Backtest Strategy Platform â€” User Stories
Jash Dedhia & Omkar Sontake
The goal of this project is to build a simple *backtest strategy platform* that lets users test trading ideas on historical data and see results in the form of metrics and reports.

## User Stories

1. *As a student analyst*, I want to load historical price data, so that I can use it to test strategies.
2. *As a strategy developer*, I want to define basic buy/sell rules, so that I can quickly check how they would have performed in the past.
3. *As a classmate running tests*, I want the system to apply simple assumptions like fees and slippage, so that the results look closer to reality.
4. *As a student preparing my report*, I want to see performance metrics (CAGR, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown) and equity curve charts, so that I can easily evaluate and present my findings.
5. *As a teammate sharing work*, I want results saved as CSV and charts, so that others can replicate my test.
